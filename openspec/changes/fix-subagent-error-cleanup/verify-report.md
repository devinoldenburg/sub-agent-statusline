## Spec Compliance Matrix

| Spec scenario | Covering runtime test(s) | Runtime result | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stale terminal `error` hides from default view like stale `done` | `src/render.test.ts` — `applies done-row recency parity to stale and recent error rows` | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |
| Recent terminal `error` remains visible and contributes to `err` | `src/render.test.ts` — recency parity; `src/tui.test.ts` — active/recent retained counters | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |
| Running work does not reveal stale errors | `src/render.test.ts` — `keeps running work visible without re-admitting stale error rows`; `src/tui.test.ts` — stale-error snapshot | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |
| Hidden terminal error remains historical | `src/tui.test.ts` — `keeps stale errors historical while retaining status counters` | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |
| History toggle reveals hidden terminal errors | `src/render.test.ts` — history-mode stale done/error test; `src/tui.test.ts` — default/history snapshot comparisons | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |
| Current retained history blocks other-session fallback | `src/tui.test.ts` — `keeps fallback rows and counters in the current session scope when current history is hidden` | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |
| Empty current session may fall back to other-session scope | `src/tui.test.ts` — `falls back to other session rows with matching counters when current session has no retained executions` | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |
| Hidden completed rows still contribute to `done` | `src/render.test.ts` — retained terminal status counts; `src/tui.test.ts` — retained terminal counters separate from default rows | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |
| Visible completed history contributes to `done` | `src/tui.test.ts` — history snapshot retains same counts while rows reappear | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |
| Running header counts retained terminal history | `src/render.test.ts` — header contains `1 running · 6 done · 7 error · Σ 13 total`; `src/tui.test.ts` — default row list has only `ses_running`, counters `{ running: 1, done: 6, error: 7 }`, history reveals retained terminal rows | ✅ Passed | COMPLIANT |

## Required Verification Focus

| Focus | Result | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Phase 8 tasks checked | ✅ | `tasks.md` has Phase 8 tasks 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 checked |
| Current hidden retained history blocks fallback | ✅ | `resolveTuiSubagentSnapshot()` gates fallback on `ownVisibleChildren.length === 0`, `ownTotalExecuted === 0`, and `otherVisibleChildren.length > 0`; test verifies no other-session rows when current retained `done/error` exists |
| Allowed fallback keeps one scope | ✅ | When current session has no visible rows and no retained real executions, fallback uses `otherChildren` for rows, retained counts, and `Σ`; test verifies rows `ses_other_running`, counts `{ running: 1, done: 1, error: 0 }`, and `Σ 2` |
| Retained `done/error` header counts vs default filtering | ✅ | `renderStatusLine()` details use `visibleSubagentWorkItems()` while aggregate uses `countRetainedSubagentStatuses()` |
| History/toggle behavior | ✅ | `showCompletedHistory` reveals hidden terminal rows and preserves retained counts/`Σ` |
| OpenSpec invariant updated | ✅ | Spec and design both state that TUI visible rows, retained counters, and `Σ` must remain in the same session scope |
| Terminal pruning unchanged | ✅ | `pruneTerminalChildren()` still prunes `done`/`error` by TTL/cap; tests cover old `error` pruning |

## Correctness Review

| Area | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Fallback predicate | Current-session fallback is blocked by any retained/historical real execution, not just visible rows. | ✅ Correct |
| Fallback totals | When fallback is active, `totalExecuted` is recomputed from `otherChildren`, avoiding current-scope `Σ 0` mixed with other rows/counts. | ✅ Correct |
| Retained counters | `countRetainedSubagentStatuses()` delegates to existing correlation semantics, so wrappers/proxies do not inflate counts. | ✅ Correct |
| Parent scoping | Helper scopes children by `parentSessionID` before correlation; state tests verify scoped counts exclude another parent’s error. | ✅ Correct |
| Default visibility | `visibleSubagentWorkItems()` still filters terminal rows by recency and active-message relation. | ✅ Correct |
| `Σ` total | TUI uses `countHistoricalSubagentExecutions()` for current or fallback scope; statusline uses retained `state.totalExecuted`. | ✅ Correct |

## Design Coherence

| Design decision | Implementation evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Separate visibility from aggregation | Details use `visibleSubagentWorkItems()`; counters use retained status helper. | ✅ Matches |
| Add retained status-count helper beside historical counting | `src/state.ts` exports `countRetainedSubagentStatuses()` next to `countHistoricalSubagentExecutions()`. | ✅ Matches |
| Use correlation/scoping semantics | Helper counts `correlateSubagentWorkItems(scopedChildren)` results, not raw children. | ✅ Matches |
| Keep history toggle behavior | `showCompletedHistory` reveals collapsed retained rows without changing retained counts. | ✅ Matches |
| Preserve pruning TTL/cap | State pruning remains terminal-status based and is regression-tested for `error`. | ✅ Matches |
| Keep TUI fallback scope consistent | `resolveTuiSubagentSnapshot()` switches rows, retained counters, and `Σ` together only when current scope has no visible rows and no retained executions. | ✅ Matches |
| Avoid broad/public API rename | Internal `visibleCounts` name retained for compatibility; values now represent retained counts. | ✅ Acceptable minor naming deviation |

## TDD Compliance

| Check | Result | Details |
|---|---|---|
| TDD evidence reported | ✅ | Apply-progress Engram #3888 contains a TDD Cycle Evidence table for all 24 tasks |
| All tasks have tests/evidence | ✅ | 24/24 rows reference behavior tests or verification commands |
| RED confirmed | ✅ | Apply-progress records Phase 8 RED failures for hidden-current-history fallback and mixed fallback `Σ`; current tests exist in `src/tui.test.ts` |
| GREEN confirmed | ✅ | Current focused/full/coverage runs pass 122/122 tests |
| Triangulation adequate | ✅ | State helper, render aggregate, TUI default/history snapshots, current-scope fallback blocker, and allowed fallback paths are all covered |
| Safety net for modified files | ✅ | Apply-progress records baseline safety nets; this verification reran scoped/full tests, typecheck, build, coverage |

**TDD Compliance**: 6/6 checks passed.

## Test Layer Distribution

| Layer | Tests | Files | Tools |
|---|---:|---:|---|

## Changed File Coverage

Coverage tool available via `pnpm test:coverage`. Production changed-file coverage:

| File | Line % | Branch % | Uncovered Lines | Rating |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `src/render.ts` | 85.14% | 72.41% | 18-20, 25, 48, 63, 76, 81, 103, 107, 130-138 | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| `src/state.ts` | 88.23% | 72.91% | 70-71, 203, 253, 307-308, 310-312, 315, 371-372, 382, 386-390, 394, 416, 430, 458, 630, 713-715 | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| `src/tui.tsx` | Excluded | Excluded | Excluded by `vitest.config.ts` | ➖ Not reported |

Coverage is informational under Strict TDD verify; no covered changed production file is below the 80% warning threshold. `src/tui.tsx` is explicitly excluded from coverage by project config but is exercised through `src/tui.test.ts`.

## Assertion Quality

**Assertion quality**: ✅ All new change-related assertions verify real behavior.

Audit notes:
- No tautologies, ghost loops, smoke-only assertions, CSS/internal-state assertions, or assertions without production code calls were found in the change-related tests.
- Empty-list assertions are paired with non-empty retained-count/history assertions for the same behavior flow.
- The only `toBeDefined()` matches found are pre-existing or unrelated to this correction and are not used as proof for fallback scope behavior.

## Quality Metrics

**Linter**: ➖ Unavailable per `openspec/config.yaml`  
**Type Checker**: ✅ No errors (`pnpm typecheck`)  
**Build**: ✅ Successful (`pnpm build`)  
**Diff hygiene**: ✅ `git diff --check` clean

## Issues

### CRITICAL

None.

### WARNING

None.

### SUGGESTION

None.

## Risks

None blocking archive readiness. Minor internal naming risk remains: `TuiSubagentSnapshot.visibleCounts` now represents retained status counts for compatibility, not strictly visible row counts.

## Skipped Checks

None. Full artifacts were available: proposal, spec, design, tasks, and apply-progress.

## Final Verdict

PASS — the final pre-commit scope fallback correction satisfies the OpenSpec requirements. Current-session retained hidden terminal history blocks fallback to other sessions; allowed fallback keeps visible rows, retained status counters, and `Σ` in the same other-session scope; Strict TDD evidence is valid; focused tests, full tests, typecheck, build, coverage, and diff hygiene all passed.

## Next Recommended

Proceed to `sdd-archive`.
